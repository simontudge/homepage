            Cooperation is vital for maintaining the integrity of complex life forms. In many cases in nature cooperation manifests itself through constituent parts performing different, but complementary, functions. The vast majority of studies on the evolution of cooperation, however, look only at the special case in which cooperation manifests itself via the constituent parts performing identical tasks. In this paper we investigate a class of games in which the socially optimal behaviour has the property of being heterogeneous. We show that this class of games is equivalent to a region of ST space (the space of normalised two-player games characterised by the 'sucker' and 'temptation' payoffs) which has previously been dismissed. We analyse, through a simple group selection model, properties that evolving agents would need to have in order to "solve" this dilemma. Specifically we find that positive assortment on pure strategies may lower mean individual payoff, and that assortment on mixed strategies will increase payoff, but not maximise it.

            Current theories of social evolution predict the direction of selection for a given level of assortment. What remains unclear is how to determine the direction of selection on assortment itself if this were subject to evolutionary change. Here we define and analyse a simple model that allows us to investigate the evolution of assortment. We find that there is only a positive selection gradient for increased assortment if the population is polymorphic in the cooperative trait. We further show that if the individuals in question engage in multiple cooperative dilemmas simultaneously then there may be a continued selection on increased assortment which is ultimately sufficient to resolve severe dilemmas such as the prisoner's dilemma.

            Wang et. al. give an extensive review on evolutionary game theory, with a particular focus on the evolution of cooperation; an area that is of central importance to understanding many disparate biological topics. One of the key focuses of the paper is that there are potentially two differing ways of defining two-by-two games so that they can be parameterised with only two variables. This is a highly worthwhile endeavour in that it allows one to systematically investigate and categorise all such games with much greater ease. Perhaps the key result of the paper is that the authors argue that one such parameterisation is far superior to the other, as it retains predictive power even with the additional assumption of a number of reciprocity mechanisms, such as network reciprocity. We wish to draw attention to the fact that these two parameterisations can be understood as the application of two invariance theorems in evolutionary game theory. Furthermore, we complement the authors’ extensive simulations with a mathematical argument that might help explain their result in a more transparent way. We will show that one of these invariance theorems generalises to the case of an assorted population and the other does not. It may be argued that many, if not all, of the particular mechanisms of reciprocity crucially rely on the positive assortment of cooperative behaviours; if one accepts this then our result acts as an argument towards why only one game parameterisation will be sufficient for models of reciprocity.

            Introducing the concept of replication strategies this paper studies the evolution of cooperation in populations of agents whose offspring follow a social strategy that is determined by a parent's replication strategy. Importantly, social and replication strategies may differ, thus allowing parents to construct their own social niche, defined by the behaviour of their offspring. We analyse the co-evolution of social and replication strategies in well-mixed and spatial populations. In well-mixed populations, cooperation-supporting equilibria can only exist if the transmission processes of social strategies and replication strategies are completely separate. In space, cooperation can evolve without complete separation of the timescales at which both strategy traits are propagated. Cooperation then evolves through the presence of offspring exploiting defectors whose presence and spatial arrangement can shield clusters of pure cooperators.

            The mechanisms of variation, selection and inheritance, on which evolution by natural selection depends, are not fixed over evolutionary time. Current evolutionary biology is increasingly focussed on understanding how the evolution of developmental organisations modifies the distribution of phenotypic variation, the evolution of ecological relationships modifies the selective environment, and the evolution of reproductive relationships modifies the heritability of the evolutionary unit. The major transitions in evolution, in particular, involve radical changes in developmental, ecological and reproductive organisations that instantiate variation, selection and inheritance at a higher level of biological organisation. However, current evolutionary theory is poorly equipped to describe how these organisations change over evolutionary time and especially how that results in adaptive complexes at successive scales of organisation (the key problem is that evolution is self-referential, i.e. the products of evolution change the parameters of the evolutionary process). Here we first reinterpret the central open questions in these domains from a perspective that emphasises the common underlying themes. We then synthesise the findings from a developing body of work that is building a new theoretical approach to these questions by converting well-understood theory and results from models of cognitive learning. Specifically, connectionist models of memory and learning demonstrate how simple incremental mechanisms, adjusting the relationships between individually-simple components, can produce organisations that exhibit complex system-level behaviours and improve the adaptive capabilities of the system. We use the term “evolutionary connectionism” to recognise that, by functionally equivalent processes, natural selection acting on the relationships within and between evolutionary entities can result in organisations that produce complex system-level behaviours in evolutionary systems and modify the adaptive capabilities of natural selection over time. We review the evidence supporting the functional equivalences between the domains of learning and of evolution, and discuss the potential for this to resolve conceptual problems in our understanding of the evolution of developmental, ecological and reproductive organisations and, in particular, the major evolutionary transitions.
